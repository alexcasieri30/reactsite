                If you read the "About Me" section, you know that I have done various projects throughout my academic career. 
                These include projects of all types, such as machine learning models, web applications, simple browser games, and others. 
                When I started to learn the React framework, I quickly noticed that there was a way to combine all of these projects into 
                one big conglomerate project.

                None of this could be done without the help of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/users/sign_in">The Odin Project</a>. 
                This is a free, open source, in depth, class that covers everything developers need to know about the React framework, 
                complete with various projects, documentation, and other resources.
