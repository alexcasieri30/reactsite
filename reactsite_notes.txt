- overall theme ideas
	- shop
		- more generic, smooth/rounded edges
		- modern looking
		- light/smooth colors

GAMES:
- games page
	- users can log in with their blog credentials 
		- allow me to keep track of game progress in database
	- add animations to the buttons / backgrounds
	- add small animations throughout the page, little gifs, moving shapes, etc.
	- background to the /games endpoint
		- lots of room for images/

- wheres waldo
	- almost finished -- touching up for 2 other maps
	- need to add game directions on the home page
	- game over logic
		- game over page
		- keep track of stats -- in database
		- show games table to user
- etchasketch
	- add image pixels to database
	- show the previous images on page load
- tictactoe
	- change game over screen


- home page
	- complete the site features section
	- add more images / description / titles to each section
	- read more from about me section goes to about page with "me" tab active
	- read more from the site features section goes to about page with "site" tab active


- about page - history of website / about the author
	- main content -> 2 tabs for user to click on:
		1. about the website (history/how it was made/etc)
			- different versions of it, my ideas, motivations behind it, etc.
		2. about the author (more in depth details about me)


- blog page
	- add support for categories
	- add "sort by" -> time button/dropdown
	- add support for sending direct messages
		- add database support for this

- other ideas
	- login button for any page that you are on
	- anywhere on the website, there can be a popup that asks
	the user if they want to leave a comment
		- the comment will automatically set the category based on where 
		they are in the website
	
	- idea for right side of page
		- once I get Node.js down, the right side can be a small popup 
		for users to leave comments on each page they visit
		- example: on games page, the popup says "let me know your feedback for each of these games, and how I can improve them, or any general comments about them
		- these are sent to the blog page 



GAMES PAGE --> MACHINE LEARNING PAGE

- ideas/steps

- set up a flask server with different endpoints 
	- server starts, and is used solely for the purpose of holding the python ML algorithms 
	- that are used when users click on "Machine Learning" under the games section

- previous ML projects -> titanic/boston housing/NLP
	- use those ML models to allow the user to input some values
	- those values sent to flask backend, model responds with predictions

- new ideas for "games" 
	- user enters a phrase, phrase gets sent to ML model, 
		- model spits out emotion/sentiment of the phrase
	- user uploads a picture, model tries to predict what the image is
		- user upload input style
		- will have to do more research on this
