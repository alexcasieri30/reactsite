- overall theme ideas
	- games page --> super interactive
		- lot going on
		- things moving all over the place
		- colorful backgrounds
	- shop
		- more generic, smooth/rounded edges
		- modern looking
		- light/smooth colors

- games page
	- add animations to the buttons / backgrounds
	- add small animations throughout the page, little gifs, moving shapes, etc.
	- background to the /games endpoint
	- title "Featured Games" interactive with animation
		- lots of room for images/


- home page
	- infinite scroll down with small example sections from each page
	- add more creative way to display the different pages that the website offers
		- the dashboard is boring as fuck

- about page
	- work experience
	- interests
	- link to an image gallery perhaps


- footer
	- link to GitHub, linked, Contact Me page
	- also could be a Link to a "history of this website" page
		- here I detail all of the steps I took to making the website
		- different versions of it, my ideas, motivations behind it, etc.

- idea for right side of page
	- once I get Node.js down, the right side can be a small popup 
	  for users to leave comments on each page they visit
	- example: on games page, the popup says "let me know your feedback for each of these games, and how I can improve them, or any general comments about them
	- these are sent to the blog page 

- blog page
	- users can add general blog posts on general topics
	- users can view others and query by topic / time / most liked
	- users can view others' comments for each page in the website
