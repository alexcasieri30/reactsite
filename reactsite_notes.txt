GAMES:
- games page
	- users can log in with their blog credentials 
		- allow me to keep track of game progress in database
	- title "Featured Games" interactive with animation
	- add animations to the buttons / backgrounds
	- add small animations throughout the page, little gifs, moving shapes, etc.
	- background to the /games endpoint
		- lots of room for images/

- wheres waldo
	- almost finished -- touching up for 2 other maps
	- need to add game directions on the home page
	- game over logic
		- game over page

		- show games table to user

- home page
	- complete about the author snippet

- footer
	- link to GitHub, linked, Contact Me page

- about page - history of website / about the author
	- main content -> 2 tabs for user to click on:
		1. about the website (history/how it was made/etc)
			- different versions of it, my ideas, motivations behind it, etc.
		2. about the author (more in depth details about me)



- blog page
	- add support for categories
	- add user passwords into database
	- add "sort by" -> time button/dropdown

- other ideas
	- anywhere on the website, there can be a popup that asks
	the user if they want to leave a comment
		- the comment will automatically set the category based on where 
		they are in the website
	
	- idea for right side of page
		- once I get Node.js down, the right side can be a small popup 
		for users to leave comments on each page they visit
		- example: on games page, the popup says "let me know your feedback for each of these games, and how I can improve them, or any general comments about them
		- these are sent to the blog page
